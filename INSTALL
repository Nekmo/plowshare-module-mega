MEGA plugin for Plowshare : installation notes

$ make install

# In common case, plowshare4 is already installed and you want to add
# mega in plowshare4's internal configuration file. You should invoke:

$ make patch_config

Note: for non-root users, adding sudo might be necessary.

You can define a custom installation prefix (default prefix is /usr/local):

$ make install PREFIX=/usr

If you are directly working on a cloned plowshare git repository you can do:

$ PLOWDIR=/path/to/plowshare/src make install patch_config


# vim: set fileencoding utf-8
