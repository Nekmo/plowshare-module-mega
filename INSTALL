mega.co.nz module for Plowshare : installation notes

It requires libcrypto.so to work and some headers for compilation.
On Debian this does the trick: apt-get install libssl-dev

$ make install

# In common case, plowshare4 is already installed and you want to add
# mega in plowshare's internal configuration file (config). You should invoke:

$ make patch_config

Note: for non-root users, adding sudo might be necessary.

You can define a custom installation prefix (default prefix is /usr):

$ make install PREFIX=/usr/local

If you are directly working on a cloned plowshare git repository you can do:

$ PLOWDIR=/path/to/plowshare/src make install patch_config


# vim: set fileencoding utf-8
